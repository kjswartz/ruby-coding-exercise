# Kyle's Coding Exercise 

## Running App
- Clone entire repository to desktop in order to run. 
- Navigate to code directory via command line.
- This is a ruby script so you will need to install ruby on your machine if not already.
```
$ ruby main.rb <path-to-file>" 
```
- "path-to-file" is in relation to main.rb file. To run with included sample-input file use below
```
$ ruby main.rb sample-input.txt" 
```

## Tests
- Tests utilize rspec so you will need to install the Gemfile via bundler.
- Install bundler if not already on your machine
- Navigate to the code directory
- run bundle install to install rspec
```
$ bundle install
```
- Now you can run rspec tests 
```
$ bundle exec rspec
```
